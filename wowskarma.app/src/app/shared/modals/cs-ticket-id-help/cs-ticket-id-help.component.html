    <h4>What is a Customer Support Ticket ?</h4>

    <p class="text-body">
      Wargaming's Customer Support (aka CS or Player Support) helps players with any issue related to the game.
      Submitting a ticket to CS is the best way to get help with your issue, may it be a bug, a technical problem, or a report.
    </p>

    <h4>How is this related to WOWS Karma ?</h4>

    <p class="text-body">
      WOWS Karma is a community-based platform that is separate from the Customer Support system.
      While endorsed, we are not affiliated to Wargaming. This means that our posts aren't systematically sent to WG for reporting.
    </p>

    <p class="text-body">
      While CS does occasionally receive some of our posts through tickets,
      insight from Wargaming shows that this is only a minuscule percentage of the posts currently on our platform.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h4>Why should I submit a ticket to Customer Support ?</h4>

    <p class="text-body">
      WOWS Karma has no power whatsoever on negative events, and <b>our staff is unable to take action on players</b>.
      The only party able to effectively take action on players is Wargaming's Customer Support.
    </p>

    <p class="text-body">
      If you encounter a player that is acting negatively, submitting a ticket to CS is the best way to get them sanctioned.
      This is why, <strong>if you feel that the player you're posting on has broken the rules, we <u>strongly</u> encourage you to submit a ticket right away</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>How do I submit a ticket to Customer Support ?</h4>
    <p class="text-body">
      To submit a ticket to WG's {{ region() }} Customer Support, you can follow these links depending on your issue :
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a [href]="csLinks()[0]" rel="external" target="_blank">Report : Gameplay Violation / Collusions</a></li>
      <li><a [href]="csLinks()[1]" rel="external" target="_blank">Report : Chat Issues / Inappropriate Behaviour</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once reported, then come back here with your Ticket ID.
      This will help us, Wargaming, and others know that the affected user has already been reported for a given issue.
